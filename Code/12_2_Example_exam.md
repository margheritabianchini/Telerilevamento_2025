## Data gathering

Data were **gathered** from the [Earth Observatory site](https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/).

Packages used:

``` r
library(terra)
library(imageRy)
library(viridis) # used to change the color ramp palette
```

Setting the working directory and importing the data:

``` r
setwd("~/Desktop/") # fow Windows users change the back slash \ to slash /
dust = rast("dust.jpg
plot(dust)
dust = flip(dust)
plot(dust)
```

The image looks like:

![dustout](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9e950e6-05ad-463c-89bc-b2d81a808b7d)

## Data analysis

Based on the data gathered, we can calculated the following index:

``` r
dustindex = dust[[1]]- dust[[3]]
plot(dustindex)
```
The output image is the following:

![dustindex](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d99d740-0f43-4f7a-b50f-a0ddb78321fe)

## Correlation of bands

Since the RGB is composed by visible bands, a high correlation is expected:

``` r
pairs(dust)
```

This is also graphically apparent:

## Visualization of the image

The visualization of the index can be changed to any viridis palette:

``` r
plot(dustindex, col=inferno(100))
```

The image will look like:

![dustinferno](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f871cc40-afb8-4d0b-9ce0-b3d6bcb7ace0)
